# Homework 1 - After Chapter 5

## Exercise 1  
Write a function named *print_tic_tac_toe* that makes use of variables and prints out a tic-tac-toe board like this:
```
  |  | 
--------
  |  |  
--------
  |  |  
```

## Exercise 2 - User Input
Do this exercise in homework 1.py. In this exercise, we will ask the user for his/her first and last name, and date of birth, and print them out formatted. Recall that you can get input from the user using the command input(‘‘text’’), as shown in lecture.

Note: The input function turns whatever the user inputs into a string automatically. 

Here is an example of what this program should do:
Output:
```
Enter your first name: Chuck
Enter your last name: Norris
Enter your date of birth:
Month? March
Day? 10
Year? 1940
Chuck Norris was born on March 10, 1940.
```
In the above example, the program output 'Enter your first name: ' and the user typed 'Chuck'.

To print a string and a number in one line, you just need to separate the arguments with a comma (this works for any two types within a print statement). The comma adds a space between the two arguments. For example, the lines:
```
mo = ’October’
day = ’20’
year = ’1977’
print(mo, day, year)
```
will have the output
```
October 20 1977
```

## Exercise 3 - New Operators
The operators +=, -=, *=, /= change the value of a stored variable in a quicker way. In the following example, we add 6 to a variable in two different ways; note that we get the same result! Try using all of these operators in your interpreter window before moving on.
```
>>> x = 5
>>> x = x + 6
>>> print x
11
>>> y = 5
>>> y += 6
>>> print y
11
```
