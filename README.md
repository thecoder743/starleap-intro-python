## Cost Management
- Free plan: 120 core-hours/month (~60 hours on 2-core).
- Stop Codespaces when idle: github.com/codespaces.
- Delete after submission to avoid storage costs ($0.07/GB/month beyond 15 GB).
- See [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing).

## Merging Updates
If the instructor updates the framework code, merge changes into your fork:
1. In Codespaces, add the upstream remote: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/your-username/python-class-6189.git`.
2. Fetch updates: `git fetch upstream`.
3. Merge updates: `git merge upstream/main`.
4. Resolve conflicts if any (use VS Code’s Source Control panel).
5. Push changes: `git push`.
